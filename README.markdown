Doomsday Trainer
================

A program that generates random dates.
Then you try your best to answer which weekday the specified date is on, using John Conway's Doomsday algorithm.

Created with C#/WPF.

Installing on Windows:
	* Move the DoomsdayTrainer.exe, in the DoomsdayTrainer/bin/Debug/ folder, to any place you like (or leave it be).
	* Create an entry in the Task Scheduler, specify a trigger (e.g. on workstation unlock or every 2 hours) and the action (run DoomsdayTrainer.exe).
	* Get super-good at using the Doomsday algoritm.
